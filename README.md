This repository is made to represent the ORDINALS and their On chain Json Formats together.  Why Json ? Why not original files?  We're here creating a Ordinal collection for Brc 2.0 utility and usage. Brc20 used to be fun with json and text inscriptions.  We're here trying to bring back the bridge between Ordinals and Brc20 .

How to find your linked ordinal? 

There'll be a spreadsheet given , in which there will be 2 columns.

one with The ordinal genesis file number and on another column a random hex number linked to it .

For example, the genesis file is 77.png and the hex number connected to it is 0x4d

We'll provide a full folder of all genesis files here and don't worry about the file size. 

We'll provide the json files with the hex number connected to the Ordinal on the minting platform . So basically all you're minting is a json file with super low cost.

After you mint your json inscription, check the hex number in it and download the Genesis file from the spreadsheet to get your high resolution Ordinal genesis file linked to the Hex number and use it as pfp or social interaction platforms.
