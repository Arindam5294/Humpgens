This repository is made to represent the ORDINALS and their On chain Json Formats together.  Why Json ? Why not original files?  We're here creating a Ordinal collection for Brc 2.0 utility and usage. Brc20 used to be fun with json and text inscriptions.  We're here trying to bring back the bridge between Ordinals and Brc20 .
